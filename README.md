I specialize in generative AI evaluation, multilingual prompt engineering, and dataset development for LLMs. My work involves designing instruction patterns, reducing hallucinations, and contributing high-quality SFT and RLHF datasets used in model training and benchmarking.

I also work on frontend development, React-based UI systems, and scalable JavaScript applications.
