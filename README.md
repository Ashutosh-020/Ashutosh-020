- 👋 Hi, I’m @Ashutosh-020
- 👀 I’m interested in AI Modeling and Training, Web Designing and Data Annotations
- 🌱 I’m learning to build scalable, RESTful APIs, handle server-side logic, connect databases like MongoDB, and structure backend applications using modern frameworks like Express.js. 
     Passionate about clean code, asynchronous programming, and real-world project building, I aim to create reliable and efficient server-side solutions.
     Constantly improving through hands-on practice and real-life problem-solving, I'm on the path to becoming a full-stack developer.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to AI training
